# Backup Detection Scripts

This repository contains three Python scripts designed to detect backup solutions, services, and related processes on different systems: **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS/Unix-like systems**.

Each script is tailored to the operating system's environment, checking for:
- Installed backup software
- Running backup processes
- Backup-related services
- Backup snapshots (LVM for Linux, Time Machine for macOS)
- Scheduled cron jobs related to backups

## Overview

1. **Windows**: `backup_detection_windows.py`
    - Detects installed backup software via registry and file paths.
    - Identifies running backup processes.
    - Checks for Shadow Copies.
    - Lists backup-related scheduled tasks.

2. **Linux**: `backup_detection_linux.py`
    - Detects installed backup software via package manager.
    - Identifies running backup processes.
    - Checks for backup-related services.
    - Looks for LVM snapshots (used for backups).
    - Scans cron jobs for backup-related tasks.

3. **macOS/Unix-like**: `backup_detection_macos.py`
    - Detects installed backup software via Homebrew and `/Applications` directory.
    - Identifies running backup processes.
    - Checks for backup-related services using `launchctl`.
    - Looks for Time Machine backups.
    - Scans cron jobs for backup-related tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Administrative or root access might be required for certain system operations.
- Ensure the required tools (`dpkg`, `lvs`, `brew`, `launchctl`, etc.) are installed for your system.
